<h1>1. Slow Network and Slow Device Simulator</h1>
Just because a website is blazing fast on your monstrous gaming PC with its 10GB/second download speed doesn't
  mean it's fast for most users. Old phones relying on laggy connections are still trending.
<p>
  Open the performance tab and click the gear icon in the upper-right corner to show the slow network simulation
  and CPU throttling options.</p><figure>

<h3>2. Responsive Mode</h3>
<p>CSS can become tricky, borderline hellish. But once again, the almighty Developer Console tool can be handy.
</p>
<p>Toggle the Device Toolbar with ctrl/cmd+shift+M or you can …</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/responsive-mode.webp" alt = " Chrome Developper Tools responsive mode>
  <figcaption>… click that.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For most people most of the time, just looking at their website through different screen sizes and orientations
  is all they need.</p>

<p>But take a look at the other drop-down called More Options (represented by three vertical dots) and you could
  find tools you didn’t know you needed.</p>

<h3>3. Screenshots</h3>
<p>Noticed the “Capture screenshot” in that last image?</p>
<p>What’s really cool about it is that you can take a full-size screenshot, meaning the whole page is saved in
  your
  screenshot, not just what’s visible now.</p>
  <p>You don’t need to be in responsive mode to take a screenshot. Use the quick command menu (shift+cmd/ctrl+p) and
  type “screenshot.”</p>
